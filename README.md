# rnd-break-choice
I recently decided to try the Pomodoro technique for my work schedule. Thought I'd make a simple Python script to randomly choose from a list of breaks as options.

More or less, this on github mearly for the sake of practice with git. But I thought it might have potential, and could evolve into something other "Pomodoro-ers" might like to have.
